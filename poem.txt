A place where we learn lot of things,
And how to conduct ourselves.
 
We are not alone or lonely,
More students to give company and love.
Far away from parents,
Feel home sick,
Nothing to be worried of.

Don't understand anything,
The teachers will help.
Make us study well, 
and learn
How to stand on our own legs.
It is a home away from home.

~Ben Lerner
